# Introduction

The learning management system is a lightweight web application which assists in student learning. 
This web application allows multiple user end points such as student, teacher and admin. Each student can enroll in multiple courses,
view class list, upload files for grading and download files uploaded by the teacher. A teacher can track the progression 
of each student in specific classes that they are teaching, view assignments and give feedback. An admin has the privilege to modify student/teacher profiles, add or remove courses to students/teachers and 
send student-teacher evaluation forms to see who is the best and worst teachers for each class.
